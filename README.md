# Snake-Game-by-Dipesh
This is a snake game coded in python using pygame.

"Snake Game" is a simple and classic snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics module. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen, which increases the snake's length. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or itself.

Use the numeric keypad to control the snake's direction:

"8" (UP)
"2" (DOWN)
"4" (LEFT)
"6" (RIGHT)
The snake will move automatically in the direction you specify.

Guide the snake to eat the food (white squares) that randomly appears on the screen.

Each time the snake eats the food, its length will increase, and your score will increase by 10 points.

The game ends if the snake collides with the border or itself.

Simple and intuitive controls using the numeric keypad.
Randomly generated food for an unpredictable gaming experience.
Increasing difficulty as the game progresses due to faster movement with each food eaten.
Score tracking with a high-score display.

Python 3.x installed on your system.
